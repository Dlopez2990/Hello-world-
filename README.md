# Hello-world-
This is my first time doing this 
My name is Daniel I have a Doberman pinscher his name is Rex he's 7 years old and I have been thinking about getting him a new friend. I'm working toward getting my BS in computer science. I'm new to GitHub and am a bit nervous because I'm not sure if am doing this right from the Hello World activity. I'm new to coding and I hope I can get a better understanding from GitHub.
